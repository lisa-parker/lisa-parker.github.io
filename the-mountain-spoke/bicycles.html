            <p>Canfield Brothers may be best known for its big hit trail bikes. But the Washington-state based company also makes some pretty fun hardtails. This week the ‘Bros’ announced the fourth generation of their steel Nimble 9 Boost 29er hardtail featuring boost hub spacing and updated geometry. “The Nimble 9 is more versatile than ever,” said Lance Canfield, owner and designer.</p>
            <p>We don’t believe full suspension bikes should get to have all the fun, that’s why we crafted a 4130 chromoly 29er hardtail that’s ready to get rowdy. The N9 combines the revered ride quality of a steel frame with our signature slack and low Canfield 29er all-mountain geo. Fresh for 2017, the N9 receives Boost 148 rear hub spacing, reach is stretched by more than an inch on all sizes for a roomier cockpit and seat tubes are shortened for increased maneuverability when you drop the saddle. Whether you’re a masochist building a singlespeed or you just want keep it real with an aggressive all-mountain steel hardtail, the N9 is ready to roll. </p>

            <p>The first trail-bike style, short chainstay, big tire hardtail is all Niner and all fun. Based on our wildly popular long travel hardtail geometry, the ROS 9 Plus delivers miles of shreddy riding. The bike features short chainstays for a playful feel (437mm at 9 o’clock BB position), while accommodating 3.0 tires for the ultimate in traction and plushness. The 29 Plus platform is the most versatile of the big-tire options – great for off season riding and a functional daily driver – and now we’ve made the most fun version of this platform available.</p>
            <p>The ROS 9 Plus is made with 4130 ChroMoly, the go-to material for high abuse applications since the early days of off-road bikes. The tubeset offers the durability and ride quality you want for rowdy rides. Complemented by custom forged 142x12 maxle compatible dropouts in the rear, the frame is designed to resist twist under heavy pedal loads and when cornering and descending. The frame also features high quality details such as internal and external dropper routing, removable cable guides and custom forged seat and chainstay bridges.</p>

          <div class="bike-info">
            <p>Designed as a trail friendly bike with all mountain capabilities, the Marley is created for exploration, adventure and play.  It is for people that ride with their saddle up as much as their saddle down. At home on any terrain; from tearing around your local trail centre, snaking down your local singletrack or back country adventures in the middle of nowhere; it will push your skills to new limits and beyond!</p>
            <p>Our updated trail geometry has been designed to mimic the characteristics of a modern full suspension bike but obviously without the sag at the rear. This is why our bikes seem slack when static. However once the rider is on the bike, the front suspension will sag, steepening the head angle by the desired amount.</p>
            <p>The new Marley should see you climbing up, going along and flying down faster than ever before!</p>
