            <p class="about">Adventure Trail is one of our favorite trails here at the Mountain Spoke. It is a solid mid-level adventure tour, which appeals to those who love dirt trails with lots of hills and vales. Much of the trail meanders along the edge of Rouge River. There are several windy hills to traverse, which provide a nice challenge. But the most loved sections of Adventure trail are the great jump off points, which appeal to cyclists who enjoy putting some air between them and the ground.</p>
