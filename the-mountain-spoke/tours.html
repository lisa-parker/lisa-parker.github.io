The trail conditions vary as you make your way up the winding gravel slopes. Rocky climbs along the trail present a considerable challenge, but once you make your way past these slopes, you are immediately rewarded for your efforts by spectacular the mountain views and cool mountain breezes.</p>

            <p class="about">Adventure Trail is among our favorites here at the Mountain Spoke. It's a solid mid-level adventure, which appeals to those who love dirt trails and a lot of hills and vales. Much of the trail meanders along the edge of Rue River. There's a long winding hill to traverse, which is a great challenge. But the most popular sections of Adventure trail are the great natural ramps, which appeal to cyclists who enjoy putting a little air between them and the ground.</p>

            <p class="about">Bicyclers looking for a smooth and relaxed mountain bicycling tour often choose the Mountain Glide Trail. This tour is especially great for beginners as well as for families with children. The trail is fairly level, with only gently sloping rises as you progress along. The tour stops for lunch at Pinewood Park to enjoy the refreshing shade and lovely mountain and river views. Then itâ€™s back on the trail to finish out an enjoyable day on Mountain Glide.</p>
